Comment:
	1. For the FactoryMethod in the ItemFactory.cs, good passing the parameters Vector2 posS and Vector2 posE.
	By determinining the final position and Starting position of one item, FactoryMethod can make a mass produce of regular
	and repeated items like bricks or coins.
	2. For the BackgroundFactory.cs, good use of switch cases to divides different background items into different layers.
	In the default case, using the Nullcharacter to meet the speical case conditions.

Hypothesis:
	1. The FacotoryMethod efficiently increase items setting in our stage. When we meet the regular size or repeated items
	like horizontal roads and coins arranged in one lines. We can call FacotoryMethod to generate them in a simplier way.
	2. If we need to add more background items like clouds and hills, we just call AddBackground to divide items into separate layers.
