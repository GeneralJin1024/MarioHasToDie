Comment:
	1. In this class, we have multiple variables of objects to represent the properties of our objects.
	For example, velocity, position, isHidden, isLeft etc. The advantage of it is that the class manages 
	those basic properties together, which is clear and easy to find, also easy to use.

Hypothesis:
	1. In the future, if we need some other properties of Mario, items, or enemies, we can add them
	in MoveParameters Class for us to find and use easily.
