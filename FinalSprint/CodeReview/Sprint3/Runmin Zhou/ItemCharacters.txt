Comment:
	1. GetHeightAndWidh() is the same method for all of the item class, so it can written in the
	ItemCharacter class. Then every class inherit it will have this method. 
	2. It's also same for the collide with mario method. Except pipes, other items will disappear
	after collide with mario. So, this method also can be written in the ItemCharacter class.
	Then overwrite it in the pipe class.

Hypothesis:
	1. In the future, if we need to add some features that all of the item have it, we can directly add it
	in the itemcharacter class.
