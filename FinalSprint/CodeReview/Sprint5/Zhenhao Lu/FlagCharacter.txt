Comment:
	1.  Creating flag inside of the constructor of FlagCharacter is a good way to implement both
	the flag and pole. The flag will only depends on the flag pole. That means, it will do something
	only when the pole (FlagCharacter) ask it to do so. In collision system, it will not collide with
	Mario and will not be a new ItemCharacter, so that there is not more changes in ItemFactory.
	2. The flag has only one frame, it should move (Update its position) only when the Mario 
	collide with the pole. To do that, you used a boolean type variable to implement it. It's a
	good idea. However, I think you can do it simplier since from player side, an object will not
	move in two situations: The first one is no updating and the second one is no velocity. Hence
	you can just change the flag's velocity to (0, x) when Mario collide with it and keep its velocity
	(0,0) before collision.
	3. My purpose of creating the variable "velocity" is to make programmers only use it to 
	control objects movement in general cases. So I hope you can replace the SetPosition() in 
	Update() with setting velocity in MarioCollide()
Time: 20 min
Hypothesis:
	1. In the future, if someone else who did not attend our designing wants to change the falling 
	speed of flag, he may feel complex for the SetPosition() part and may be easy to make mistakes.
