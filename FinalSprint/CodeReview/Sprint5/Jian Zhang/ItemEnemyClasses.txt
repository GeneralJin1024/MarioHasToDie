Comment:
	1. In the ItemEnemyClasses, good adding some new interesting enemies like (cloud, Boss and Bomb),
	which makes the mario level one more challenging and abundant. Good use of two collide respond functions
	MarioCollide and BlockCollide, those two functions separate the different cases of bomb collision.
	2. For the bomb and cloud generating position, good applying the RandomNumberGenerator.cs to set 
	the bomb releasing positions.
Time: 20 minues
Hypothesis: 
	1. The velocity of Bomb can be changed to slower. The current releaseing speed is too fast for player
	to make a reaction. Also, the range and scope of bomb can be better setting to control the difficult level
	of game.
