Comments:
	1. Good use method to detect all of the possible collide object. Using velocity's deriction really reduce lots of useless detection.
	2. The switch used in the CollidePairTest is very good which avoid lots of if else.
	3. Good use method to distinguish all of the objects to their own tile map.
	4. Good ideas to create objects' type.
Time: 100 min
hypothesis:
    1. It's good for future use.
    2. When there are more than one moving object, the method may be needed modified.
