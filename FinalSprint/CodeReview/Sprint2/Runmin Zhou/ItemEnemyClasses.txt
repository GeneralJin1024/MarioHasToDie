Comments:
	1. In ItemEnemyClasses, good using the abstract methods like MarioCollide() and abstract Vector2 GetHeightAndWidth(). Then all of 
	the classes which inherit it can have different way to implement this method. 
	2.ItemCharacter classes creates abstract class. Then  all the item can inherit it, which reduce the reduandancy.

hypothesis:
    1. Enemy class may need add some method like timing to hide the dead enemy or respown coopa.
