Comments:
	1. In the CollideDectorTest.cs, Good using the possibleCollideList arraylist to collect all possible collide items by calling
	the GetPossibleCollidedObject method implemented in the TileMapTest class. The GetPossibleCollidedObject calcualte the current 
	grid position and give the possible colliding items with mario in one update time.
	2. The switch cases used in the Collide() method in class CollidePairTest is also a very good idea.
	Based on the items type, different items will response to mario if they detect the collision.
Time: 100 min
hypothesis:
    1. Implementing Boolean algebra expressions just like in the GetPossibleCollidedObject1 may reduce the use 
	  of if else clause and improve code efficiency.
