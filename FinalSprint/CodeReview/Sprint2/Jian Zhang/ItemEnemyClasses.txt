Comments:
	1. In ItemEnemyClasses, good using the abstract methods MarioCollide() and abstract Vector2 GetHeightAndWidth() to 
	avoid the code redundancy.
	2. The abstract class ItemCharacter inherits from the Interface ICharacter, and it also add some specific abstract methods
	for the EnemyCharacter.cs to implement. The two item locations methods GetMaxPosition() and GetMInPosition() can directly 
	return the scope of Enmey's movement, which is also very nice idea.
Time: 40 min
hypothesis:
    1. The ItemEnemyClass may need to add some new abstract methods to fit for the future implements of new items and different 
	types of enemy states.
