Comment:
	1. Divide the game into several scens(only 1 scene in this Sprint). Move the code
	from Sprint1Main.cs to Scene and Stage. So that the main program know less than before
	It's good from the privacy of code.
	2. If we have more than one map in the future, that means there will be more than one scene.
	However, each scene has the same stage. Controllers are created in stage. That means, each
	scene's controller connect with the same Mario, which is the Mario in first map. Hence
	we will add code to reset Mario's position when change maps in next Sprint.
Time: 30min
Hypothesis:
	1. If we need to add a new map in the game. We only need to create a new Scene with
	different parameters and we can even do this in configuration file. We just add a new level
	to store parameter values for new map.
