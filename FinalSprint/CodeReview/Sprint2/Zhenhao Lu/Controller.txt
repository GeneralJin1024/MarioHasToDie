Comment:
	1. Modify the Mario type from Mario to MarioCharacter is good
	2. Also modify the Commands
	3. Try to set two key-value maps for distinguishing "pressed" and "hold"?
	So that we just need to do one more check with the new map.
Time: 10min
Hypothesis: 
	1. Only need to change a little part when we add some command that need holding keys
	2. Need to change the parameter's type(Mario->MarioCharacter) when We change Mario's
	type. Maybe we should create an abstract Mario class and let Mario Character(s) inherit it
	to prevent Controllers always changing because of Mario.
