Comment:
	1. Good use of abstract classes to avoid writing the same code for Update and Draw when
	implementing different items.
	2. The implemention of EnemyCharacter is a little different from ItemCharacter. It didn't
	include an "Enemy" as field. Instead, he directly create two ISprite in Character. This is also
	a good idea, because both enemies have two frames and they do the same thing when its
	top collide with Mario  -- change to died. So he doesn't need to create an abstract class
	and implement each enemy seperately
Time: 30 min
Hypothesis: 
	1. For ItemCharacter, if we need to add a new item, we can directly create a new class that 
	implement ItemCharacter. It will not influence past code.
	2. For EnemyCharacter, if we need to add a new enemy such as Chomper which will not be 
	died when collides with Mario. He may need to change the class EnemyCharacter and do the
	same thing as ItemCharacter.
