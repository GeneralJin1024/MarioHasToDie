Files: NullCharacter.cs
Author: Shengyu Jin
Comment:
	1. Good use of null character considering meeting wrong sprite name. 
	2. Null character is always useless(Maybe). Shall we consider return null instead of
	NullCharacter when read wrong sprite name from App.config? We can judge whether this 
	object is null before adding it to character list.
Time: 20min
Hypothesis:
	1. If we want to add new Characters, this will be a good template.
