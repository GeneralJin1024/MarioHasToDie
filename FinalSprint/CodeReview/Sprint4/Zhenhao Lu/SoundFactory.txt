Comment:
	1. Good use of playing sound effect by calling SoundFactory's method, so that other
	classes that need it didn't need to consider how to play the sound effect. Different from BGM,
	a sound effect will not use single instance. For example, Mario continuouts get coins.
	2. However, I still recommend to create an instance when the method is call because we can
	freely change it's volume and other parameters.
	3. Except creating instance for sound effect, I suggested to modify the method parameter list
	so that the classes which will call them can freely determine the parameter of sound effect.
	4. Since unknow loading error, I used SoundEffect to replace Song for BGM. To make sure
	there is only one bgm in the game, I used an instance of it and other classes can only get
	its instance. This can avoid potential bugs that more than one bgm play at the same time.

Hypothesis:
	1. In the future, if we need to add more sound effects, just load it when the factory is 
	instantiated and add new methods. Constructure will not be changed.
	2. As I said in Comment 2, if we need different sound effects have different volumes, we need
	to play its instance instead of itself.
	3. If we need to change BGM volume in different scene (or meeting some events), we can 
	directly access to BGM's instance and do what we want.
