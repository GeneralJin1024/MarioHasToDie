Comment:
	1. In the LevelManager.cs, there is a good managment of different game states (Game Win,Game Menu, Game over).
	Good use List<Sence> to append different game sences in different game situations. In the Initialize() method,
	it input all game sences and game states.
	2. In the Draw() part, I suggest that author can use eg. HUD.cs to manage different head fonts which
	showing on the top side of the game screen. May be using different classes to show the "earning points",
	"lives" and "Time Left"  will be more clear and easier to management for further change and implement.

Hypothesis:
	1. The LevelManager can be used for our further game states and game sences extensions.
	The whole constructure will not be change, and we can just add mehtods to implement on different
	sences and mode changes.
