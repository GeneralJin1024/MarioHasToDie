Comment:
	1. the task of changing states is assigned to different classes of states instead of using if else statements.
        2. In sprint1, a specific state can only be damaged to anothe specific state. For example, FireState can only be damaged to Super state.
	
	
Time: 40 min
Hypothesis:
	1. If whenever we push the damage button, the state will only be changed to the previous state it had.Then we need to store the current state and pass it the every state class and make a ChangeToPrevious（） method.
