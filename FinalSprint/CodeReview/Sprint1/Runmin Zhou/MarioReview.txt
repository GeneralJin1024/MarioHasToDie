Comment:
	1. Good use of state. The state can determine the sprite mario need to show and change to another state.
	2. Good use of isprite in isprite to show the sprite.
Time: 30 min
Hypothesis: 
	1. It's good for future use. If we need more state. We just need to create more state variable in the mario class.
	2. If the game is just single player, we can make the mario singleton. So, in some classes, we do not need to pass the parameter.
