Comment: 
	1. These factories uses singleto structure. So, we do not need to pass the parameter to get the data. It's very convinent.
	2. These all the factories inherit isprite, so they can be in the same arraylist and uses for loop and add all the sprite in the 
	sprint1, which is very neat.

Time: 30 min
Hypothesis:
	1. This is good for the future use. If we want to add more sprite to sprite list, we just need to add it in the factory.
