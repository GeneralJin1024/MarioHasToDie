Comment:
	1. It parameterized good to fit all animated sprite.
	2. It uses frame size instead of the whole texture size
	3. It has the boolean variable to determine wheather flip the sprite,which saves lots of code.
Time: 15 min
Hypothesis: 
	1.It's good for future use.
	2. We can have a velocity parameter in update to change the rate of the frame
