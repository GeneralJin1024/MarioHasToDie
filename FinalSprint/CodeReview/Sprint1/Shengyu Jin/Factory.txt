Comments:
	1. Basic idea for the factory methods showed in the class
	2. Great arrangement on listing all the sprites to generate, and combining with the corresponding textures generation.
	3. Singleton Pattern would be a nice solution to design the factory.
Review Time: 30 min
Hypothesis: With the increasing types of factory, it is possible to build an abstruct factory class where the other concrete factory derivated from.
	Between the main game class and the factory class we can add a stage/level class to do the sprites drawing for the specfic level.
