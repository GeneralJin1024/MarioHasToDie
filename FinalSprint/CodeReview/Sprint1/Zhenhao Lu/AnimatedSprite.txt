Comment:
	1. Parameterized all variables to fit many cases, not only Mario.
	2. Add method to get frame's size so that other classes can directly get the size of frame 
	instead of texture.
Time: 15 min
Hypothesis: 
	1. If we add motion in the future, can directly modify Update() method with parameters to 
	keep this class flexibility. In addition, we need to add a new property named velocity so that
	it can be changed by State's method.
	2. If mario has more actions or power states, it may also have more textures with different 
	size. Then we need more if-else to change sprite's location, which is very troublesome. To
	solve this problem, I should define the field location as the coordinate of object's left lower
	corner. When we draw the sprite, we should draw it in (location + frame size).
