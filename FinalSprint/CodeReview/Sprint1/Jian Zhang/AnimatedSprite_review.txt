Comment:
	1. Good use of Update method by passing the gameTime as parameter to controll the speed of frames change.
	2. By adding a frame's size method, more powerful to get the frame sizes.
Time: 10 min
Hypothesis:
	1. In the next several sprints, mario will have more actions or power states. 
	Different mario's states and fire actions may let us use different kinds of textures. By using the frame's size
	method, we can more directly and quickly draw the sprite by using one location(vector) and frame's size.
