Comments:
	1. ICharacter is a very helpful interface while leaving MarioCharacter Class along(not implementing the interface)
	is not that helpful. There will be only some minor changes when implementing the class to the interface but a lot help
	in terms of maintainability.
	2. When it comes to using the MarioFactory method, you will generate an object of the MarioCharacter class rather than 
	an instance of ICharacter Interface like the other Character classes. It may lead to a problem that Mario is a special case which needs
	individual care. 
Time: 1hrs.
Hypothesis:
	Since the MarioCharacter Class is very similar to other Character Classes, it is resonable to make it inherit from the ICharacter Interface.
	For now, I have to create another factory method to take care of the return of the MarioCharacter object, leaving the factory method from IFactory empty.
