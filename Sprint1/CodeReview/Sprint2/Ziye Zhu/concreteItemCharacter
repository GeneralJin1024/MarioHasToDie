Comment:
	1 By using state pattern, we are saved from using a bunch of if else structures to tell which character is being acted on
    2 easier to debug.
Time: 3 hrs

hypothesis:

  It would be easier to add more item characters in the future than eiditing on the original if else code. 
  Alsoï¼Œit will looks more decent and clear if there are many different characters in the future than jaming them in many if else clauses.
