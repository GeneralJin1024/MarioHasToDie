Comment: 
	1. Good use of the state to show every state's sprite. 
	2. Good structure of the block, which has brick and block class.
	3. Good parameterization. It uses four little bricks to form a block, which can has own velocity to explode.
Time: 40 min
Hypothesis:
	In the future, when the coin bump up from the block, the coin will go up and go down a little bit. If other items bump up, they will just be above the block.
	This will change the function in item and question block and usedblocksprite. The other aspects is good for the future use, which include more states.
