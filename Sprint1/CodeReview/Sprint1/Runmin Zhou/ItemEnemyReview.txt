Comment: 
	1. It uses one class to implement all enemy. 
	2. Item is just a little bit different from the enemy class. It has a bump function, which can bump above the block. 
Time: 10 min
Hypothesis:
	1. In the future, the enemy will move and have their own states. So, it will have the state in the future to show all of the possible states. 
	2.It also will move, so it will changes a little bit of the update function, to achieve this goal.
