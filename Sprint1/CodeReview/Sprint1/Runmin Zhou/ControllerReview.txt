Comment:
	1. Good use of old keyboard state. When the key is hold, the contoller will not trigger the command, which makes more efficient.
	2. Good use of dictrinoary. It can map the key with the command.

Time: 30 min
Hypothesis: 
	1. It's good for future use. If we need more controller. We just can create a new class, which is very convinent.
