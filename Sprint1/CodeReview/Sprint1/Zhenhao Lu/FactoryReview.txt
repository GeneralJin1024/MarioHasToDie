Comment: 
	1. These factory classes use a good idea to both add object into sprite list inside factory 
	class and make main program "Sprint1.cs" be able to access some of those objects that 
	will be used for Controller.
	2. All textures are loaded inside of factories so that main program will not know which to 
	load for the game. This seperate the function of classes and increase their independency.
Time: 30 min
Hypothesis:
	1. If we need to create the whole game, we may need to load more blocks, items and 
	enemies. To archieve this, we can just changing the number and kind of objects that added 
	into spriteList. this will not change the structure.
