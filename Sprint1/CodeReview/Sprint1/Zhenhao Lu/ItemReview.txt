Comment: 
	1. Good idea to combine BlockSprite with ItemSprite, Since the item is a kind of block that 
	has animation. Since when mario jump and hit the question block both the block and item 
	hidden inside it would bump up, creating them with the same class can make system use 
	one method to control both of them.
	2. Parameterized minY and blockSpeed can easily control the question block and the item 
	hidden in it bumped with different speed.
Time: 20 min
Hypothesis:
	1. If we need to get the position of items, we can easily implement it by changing Location 
	to a property so that it can be read by other classes.
	2. If we add a function: "after mario touch this item, the item disappear." We can add a bool
	IsHidden and easily modify Draw() to draw the item only if IsHidden == false.
