Comment:
	1. The code of BackgroundSprite looks similar to AnimatedSprite except BackgroundSprite
	had an ArrayList. The differences can move to BackgroundSprites.
	2. Repeated Update(GameTime gameTime) in BackgroundSprite. Remove one.
	3. Good idea to parameterized the Y position of hills and bushes so that they will be always 
	at the bottom of screen.
	4. Do not understand why initialize Location only in the class SmallHillSprite in 
	BackgroundSprites.cs

Hypothesis:
	1. If we need different number of small cloud for two scenes, the class SmallCloudSprite 
	cannot support it because each class can generate fixed number of background items and
	most of them create more than one item each time.
