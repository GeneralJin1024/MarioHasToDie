Comment: 
	1. Each file contains a class which is very short, which is a very good point. 
	Rather than assemble all the command classes in to one single file, I perfer to separate
	different command class into different files. This is very clear and easy for my teamates to 
	locate and figure out each states and actions change.
	
	2. Try to set the type of field to Game instead of Sprint1 for QuitCommand.

Hypothesis:
    My teamate(Zhenhao Lu) suggest to set the type of field to Game instead of Sprint1 for QuitCommand.
	The method Exit() is a method of Game indeed. However, I do feel that I can use game.Exit() to quit 
	the current running game. I do want get some suggestions from our professor.
