Comment:
	1. The reset method reload all of the data from the level load file. However, we do not need to reset
	all of the things. Like mario, it do not need to be reset. We will use other function to 
	make it recover the state to before the reset. It waste time and memory. Some blocks also do not need
	to be reseted. They just stay at here and will not have any change. It also waste lots of time and memory.
Time : 20min
Hypothesis:
	1. In the future, we will have big map and have lots of blocks in the map. If we use the reset function at now,
	it will waste lots of time to rest the static blocks which is useless. We should create the reset function in the character
	class and a boolean attribute that whether it should be reset. Then we can reset the character who need to be reseted.
