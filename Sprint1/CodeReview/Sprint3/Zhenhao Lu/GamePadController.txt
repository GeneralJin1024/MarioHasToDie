Comment:
	1. Line 72-74 should move
	Line 72-73: calling ReturnCommand.Execute() should be moved outside of 
	if(curr != emptyInput) but inside of if(curr.IsConnected)
	Line74: update previous gamePad state should be done no matter a gamePad is connected.
Time: 10min
Hypothesis:
	1. If we need to add more command, just add the command and corresponding button into
	Key-Map.
