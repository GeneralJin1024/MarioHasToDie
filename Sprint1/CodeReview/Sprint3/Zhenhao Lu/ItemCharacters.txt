Comment:
	1. In each classes that implements ItemCharacter, they override the method - 
	GetHeightAndWidth(). However, each Item do the same thing for this method, so you can
	implement it in ItemCharacter
	2. Except Pipe, every item will disappear when collide with mario. That is
	Parameters.IsHidden = true. You can also move it into ItemCharacter. Only in PipeCharacter,
	override it and keep the body empty.
	3. Overall, use Abstract method and implement some same function in it is a good way and
	it can reduce the amount of code.
Time: 15min
Hypothesis:
	1. In the future, if we need to add a new function to all items, we can direclty implement 
	a part of the function, which all items should do it, in ItemCharacter.
