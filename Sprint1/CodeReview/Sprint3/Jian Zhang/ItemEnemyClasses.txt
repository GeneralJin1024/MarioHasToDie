Comment:
	1. For the ItemCharacter.cs in the ItemEnemyClasses, use the Bumping(Vector2 startP, float minY, float maxY, Vector2 blockSpeed)
	method to create the start position of bumping item. By setting the max and min humping height, the movement of stars, flowers
	and mushroom can be presented with the movement of hidden block.
	2. For each *.cs, good using Abstract method and implement some same function in it is a good way and
	it can reduce the amount of code. 
Time: 40min
Hypothesis:
	1. The ItemCharacter.cs may need to add some new abstract methods to fit for the future implements of new items and different 
	types of item states.
