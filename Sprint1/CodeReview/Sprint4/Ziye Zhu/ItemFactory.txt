Comment:
	1.ItemFactory is a good place to produce all kind of items we need, at the same time, it is a place we manage those items.
    In this sprint, we add several new items: pipe, Vpipe, Hpipe, flag with different functionalities in order to complete the secret
    level and "the game over" state.
Time: 10 min
Hypothesis:
	1. It is easy to add some new items in sprint 5ï¼Œand bring more joy and diversity.
     We just need to add new itemcharacter classes that extends Itemcharacter,and add 
     corresponding methods in itemFactory.
