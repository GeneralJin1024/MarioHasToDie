Comment:
	1 It is a decent use of Factory, in which we manage all the sound effects together,
    back to sprint 0 or sprint 1, we may use seperated classes to achieve the goal or
    jam them into a class which may also contain other functionalities.

Time: 10 min
Hypothesis:
	1. Also, it is easy to add more sound effects in the upcoming sprint 5 here at SoundFactory.txt
    without much considerations and efforts.
