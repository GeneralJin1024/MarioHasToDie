Comment:
	1. The way implement pipe makes the logic very easy. Pipe does not hold any thing, so do not need to response to anything. 
	The type attribute helps the collider to identify its type. 
	2. There is a same problem existed in the lab 3. There are some functions that holds by all of the characters classes. We can add these functions
	to the main character class. Then these functions will not need to be written.  
Hypothesis:
	1. It's easy for us to add new item. We just need to extends the item class and add some functions, then update the fatcory class.
