Comment: 

    1. Level manager sperates the level configuration file from the main class file. It enhances the readability of the main file.
    2. Level manager also can have lots of game modes. We also can reset the secene through that.

Hypothesis:
    1. In the future, if we want to add more games mode, we can just add the games mode in the  Level manager. It really enhances the independency of the
code.
