Comment:
	1. There is unexpected error when I use the <Song> to load the Background music from our original
	source files. In order to fix this problem, we try many ways (such as by loading the BGM song by 
	using url) which all do not work. At last, we use the <SoundEffect> to load our sound for BGM.
	There may be some issues or differnces in VS 2017 and VS 2019 versions, which causes this strange problem.
	2. For the SoundFactory.cs, good use of playing sound effect by calling SoundFactory's method.
	In different mario's movements sound track and SFX effect, we just need to call different methods 
	in SoundFactory to implement the sound effects which caused by different situations.
Time: 20 min
Hypothesis:
	1. In the next sprint 5, we will add more sound effects and BGM into SoundFactory.cs. We will divide
	different SFX based on different situations. Also, more detailed sound effects will be added into 
	SoundFactory.cs in order to fit for different sences. The whole constructure will not be changed.
