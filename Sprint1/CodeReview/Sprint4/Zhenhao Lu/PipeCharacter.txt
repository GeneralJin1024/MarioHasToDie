Comment:
	1. Good use of PType. Since no matter what pipe it is, it will not response to anything. So it
	only need to have a property that help mario to identify its kind. This type can replace 
	creating two more pipe character classes.
	2. It looks that for all item character classes, they have the same code for GetHeightAndWidth,
	we can try to implement this method in ItemCharacter in Sprint 5
Time: 10 min
Hypothesis:
	1. If we want to add a new Item or a new branch of certain existed item, we just need to add
	a new class that extends ItemCharacter or modify current classes and add corresponding
	factory methods in ItemFactory.
