Comment:
	1. In the item and enemy factory, there are methods to randomly generate could enemy
	and bomb. It's a very good idea, beacuse we do not need to spend time to place these 
	things and random makes game more fun. However, there are some problems in these methods. Like
	bomb item, it's too fast and player do not have time to react to this. The height is also too low sometimes.
	We can change the speed of bomb and the height of the bomb appear to avoid this.
	The cloud enemy I think works good and does not need any change.
Time: 20 minues
Hypothesis: 
	1. If we need bombs for some special scenes, we can add the the max height and the lowest height as the parameters in the fatcory to 
	contrain the bombs postion it will appear. This is as same as the cloud enemy.
