Comment:
	1. It's a good design when Boss touches the blocks, these blocks will hide. We have a hide function in the main block clas. Then every subclass
	have the hide function, which is a good design.
	2. Diretly hide is uncomfortable for visual. If there are some explode effects it will be better.

Hypothesis
	1. I think if there are some block explode function it will be better for visually. We can just add some explode sprites(which is different from 
	mario break the block) to the main block class.Then we can add the function to display the explode and then set it to hide instead of directly hide.
	Then every sub class will have this function. Then every block can explode.
