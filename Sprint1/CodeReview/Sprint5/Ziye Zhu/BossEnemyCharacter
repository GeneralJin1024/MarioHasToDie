Comment:
	1. This is a good example of chasing, when the big boss hits blocks, blocks will be destroied without exloding.
    2  this feature increases the difficulty of the second level. However it still needs to be improved in the future.
    Time: 20 min
Hypothesis:
	1. In the future, we should either decrease the speed of the boss, which is easy to achieve, or give the plyaer 1 or 2 seconds,
     in which the boss does not move so that it would be easier to win.
     2. Also, with those bombs falling down from the sky, and with the chasing boss, it literally is hard to win the game with three lives.
      So, we should keep the chasing boss and the other features, at the same time, increase the chance of winning in the future.
