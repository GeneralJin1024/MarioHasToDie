Comment:
	1. This random character is hidden in a bag, we can only tell what we got by the effect of the item. It has redmushroom,
    greenmushroom, bomb, star, coin.
    2 This character increases the randomnness of the game. However, it still could be improved.
    Time: 20 min
Hypothesis:
	1. In the future, we could make those five characters exposed to our eyes without the real bag wrapping them up.
    And those five characters should change at certain rate, also the changing scene( the animation ) should also be exposed
    to us.
    2 Also,in the future, we could increase the chance of getting a specific item by spending some coin we have collected. Say, increase 50%
    chance to get a redmushroom in the random characters list.
