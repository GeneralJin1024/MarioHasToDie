Comment:
	1. Good designing for the collision response to Boss Enemy. However, even if Mario cannot go
	to the place of blocks which are destroyed by Boss Enemy, we can make the item hidden inside
	of those blocks keep hidden instead make them appear and fall. That will add additional 
	computation to CollideDetector.

Hypothesis
	1. If we change the Block to make it keeps hiding items when destroyed by Boss Enemy, we may
	need to add a boolean variable as a parameter passed into the destroying method. Or we can
	seperate the destroy method and releasing method.
