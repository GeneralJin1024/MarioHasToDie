Comment:
	1. It's really a good idea to randomly generate cloud enemy and bomb. It can make players meet
	different dangers and increase the their interests. It can also product multiple objects with one line
	of code in configuration file.
	2. We should add some limits to the lowest place they can be generated. When I tested the game.
	I met a problem that sometimes a bomb will occur on Mario's top and very close to Mario, that
	makes that Player (I) will not have enough time to avoid the bomb.
	3. The cloud has the same problem. In the game, the cloud is big and wide. Sometimes when Mario
	arrive the highest place on stairs, there will always be a cloud enemy near him which stop him to
	go. I recommand that we only allow bomb to be generated randomly, and the cloud enemy should
	be set by ourselves.
Time: 20 minues
Hypothesis: 
	1. In the configuration file, the bomb's EndLocation is useless, in the future, we can use it as the limit
	bound to randomly generate Bombs.
