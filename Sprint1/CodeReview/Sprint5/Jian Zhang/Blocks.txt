Comment:
	1. In the BlockCharacter.cs, the author make a good use of BossEnemyCollide() function to make Blocks 
	to destoryed. When the big Boss Enemy hide the blocks, the blocks can be destoryed by the collision from
	the boss enemy. While we may add the item hidden inside of those blocks keep hidden instead of making them 
	appearing and falling. Also, some visualization applied to the blocks explosion will be better.

Hypothesis
	1. In the Blocks.cs file, we can add some more command receiver functions for blocks to call based on
	different situations that blocks may occur. More block states can be extended, we don't need just 
	limit on the previous sprites' requirements. More textures of animation and visualizations can be displayed better.
