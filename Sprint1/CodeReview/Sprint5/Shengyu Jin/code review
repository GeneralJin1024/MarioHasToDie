Comment:
	1. RandomCharacter got implemented via the existing Icharacter interface, like every other character classes.
    2. RandomCharacter has a special behavior which is distinct from other characters, the composite sprite is random, which increase the randomization of the whole game.
    3. The class should have stronger connection to the itemcharacter classes, might using the composite design pattern.
Hypothesis:
	If we need to extend the random items included in the RandomCharacter, it would be better to upgrade the RandomCharacter classes to be the parent class which those itemcharacter classes
    derived from. In this regard, we can reduce the duplicate smells.
