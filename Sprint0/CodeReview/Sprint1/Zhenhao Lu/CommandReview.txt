Comment: 
	1. Each file contains a class which is very short. Can try to assemble them into a single file
	next time. All commands are for Mario and each classes make Mario as a field variable.
	Try to construct each command without any object. When this command need to be 
	executed, pass the targeted Mario into Execute(Mario mario). 
	
	2. Try to set the type of field to Game instead of Sprint1 for QuitCommand.
Time:  20 min
Hypothesis:
	QuitCommand need to execute Game.exit(). However, the method Exit() is a method of 
	Game instead of Sprint1. In the next several Sprints, the name of Main program's name
	may change. If so, we also need to change the field's type in QuitCommand. It will take 
	editors more time to modify.
