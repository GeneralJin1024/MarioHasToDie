Comment: 
	1. Use a little code to implement Enemy, which can generate different enemy by passing 
	different texture while constructing.
	2. Double namespace is unnecessary, delete one.
Time: 10 min
Hypothesis:
	1. In next Sprint, we will add collision detection. Then we should be able to read Enemy's 
	location in collision part, so at that time we need to change the field "Location" to public
	property.
	2. In the future, if we want to make enemy moving, we can directly override Update and add 
	moving code. But we also need to add some new fields such as velocity-X.
