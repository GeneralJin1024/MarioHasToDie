Comment: 
	1. Do not need to use "this" in BlockCommand.Execute() 
	2. Good parameterization in BrickBlockSprite.cs
	3. FloorAndStairBlocks, HiddenBlockSprite, QuestionBlockSprite, UsedBlockSprite looks 
	similar, try to combine them into one class
	4. Good writing in BrickStates.cs
	5. Good use of enum type in Bricks, but it looks that integer minY and maxY can change
	to an integer array or Point?

Hypothesis:
	If we need to add new State to block, we can directly add a new class that implement 
	IBlockState as well as add a new BrickType. This changes little existing code.
