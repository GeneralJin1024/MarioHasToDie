Comment:
	1. Good use of for each loop. Rather than using for each key-value pair in keymap, using for 
	each key in PressedKey of current update can reduce the time of CPU running. 
	2. Directly get current keyboard state and gamePad state from Keyboard and GamePad will 
	reduce the number of parameters passed to KeyboardController.Update() and 
	GamepadController.Update().
	3. Suggest to update old gamepad state with current state no matter if current state is empty.
Time: 30 min
Hypothesis: 
	1. If we add a rule that Mario will return to idle if there is no input, then for gamepad we can 
	directy add an else under if(curr != emptyInput) and run MoveStandardCommand.Execute().
	For keyboard, we can add an if under for-each loop. Neither of those two controllers need
	to change existing framework.
